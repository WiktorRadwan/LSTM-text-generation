LSTM-Text-generation

Main concept of our project was to deliver generated text on the basis of previously created text by Leo Tolstoy.

We have taken LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks in order to use them as generative models. Our goal was to not use them only as predictive models but what is more they learn the sequences of a problem and then generate entirely new text.

During our project we have discovered how to create a generative model for text, with the usage of LSTM recurrent neural networks in Python with Keras.
